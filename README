*Make sure Python3 is installed on the system.

Run the following to download all the relevant modules from using pip3:
$ sudo pip3 install wikipedia
$ sudo pip3 install cPickle
$ sudo pip3 install numpy
$ sudo pip3 install nltk

To install 'nltk'-specific modules, open the python interpreter by simply running 'python3' on the terminal. Now,
>>> nltk.download()

A GUI application opens; under the 'All Packages' section, choose the following:
1) porter_test
2) stopwords

To start the GUI, run the following:
$ python3 GUI.py

** In case of 'module not found' errors, rerun the faulty command by prefixing it with 'sudo' ; PyQt4 and nltk might require this.
